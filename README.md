# Avyakt-Ehsaas 🧘‍♂️  
*A Mindfulness & Meditation Platform for Inner Awareness*

---

## 📖 About the Project

**Avyakt-Ehsaas** is a meditation and mindfulness application designed to help individuals slow down, reconnect with themselves, and cultivate inner peace in a noisy, fast-paced digital world.

The word **“Avyakt”** means *that which cannot be expressed in words*, and **“Ehsaas”** means *feeling*.  
Together, **Avyakt-Ehsaas** represents subtle inner experiences — silence, awareness, calm, and self-realization — which go beyond logic and language.

This project focuses on creating a **digital sanctuary** where users can experience calmness through a minimal, distraction-free interface combined with mindful content.
